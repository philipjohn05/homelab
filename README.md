# üè† Kubernetes Homelab

## üìñ Introduction

This repository contains all of the configuration and documentation of my Kubernetes homelab.

The purpose of my homelab is to **learn production patterns at scale** and to have fun experimenting with cloud-native technologies. As someone working with Kubernetes professionally, my homelab is where I can break things, learn from mistakes, and understand infrastructure deeply - without the pressure of production incidents.

Self-hosting applications forces me to think about the entire lifecycle: **backup strategies, disaster recovery, security hardening, GitOps workflows, and operational excellence**. It's one thing to deploy an app - it's another to maintain it reliably and recover from failures.

### Key Principles

- **Everything is code** - Infrastructure, applications, and configurations
- **Zero secrets in Git** - All sensitive data in Azure Key Vault
- **Immutable infrastructure** - Talos Linux enforces declarative configuration
- **Full automation** - FluxCD handles deployments from Git
- **10-minute recovery** - Entire cluster can be rebuilt from this repo

## üèóÔ∏è Cluster Provisioning & Architecture

I use **Talos Linux** to provision my Kubernetes nodes. Talos is minimal, immutable, and API-driven (no SSH access). It provides production-grade security out of the box and eliminates configuration drift entirely.

### Current Architecture

I run a **single 6-node cluster** with high availability:

| **Cluster** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **lothbrok** | Production cluster. 3 control plane nodes (HA with kube-vip) + 3 worker nodes. Runs all infrastructure components and applications. Fully provisioned from code via FluxCD GitOps. Can be destroyed and rebuilt in 10 minutes. |

### Infrastructure Components

**Control Plane:**
- 3 nodes for high availability
- kube-vip provides virtual IP for API server
- etcd cluster tolerates single node failure
- Any control plane node can fail - cluster stays operational

**Workers:**
- 3 nodes for application workloads
- Dedicated to running pods
- Resource isolation from control plane

**Network:**
- Flannel CNI (via Talos)
- MetalLB for LoadBalancer services (L2 mode)
- 4 segmented IP pools for different workload types

### GitOps Architecture

**3-Phase Deployment Pipeline:**

Phase 1: infrastructure
‚Üì (deploys controllers)
Phase 2: infrastructure-secrets
‚Üì (syncs from Azure Key Vault)
Phase 3: infrastructure-config
‚Üì (applies configs with substitution)
Result: Fully automated, zero manual intervention

**Why 3 phases?**
- Prevents race conditions (configs needing secrets that don't exist yet)
- Proper dependency ordering (operators before CRDs)
- Clean separation of concerns (controllers vs. secrets vs. configs)

## üíª Hardware

### Nodes

Running on **Proxmox VE 8.x** as the hypervisor layer:

| Node | Role | vCPU | RAM | Disk | Purpose |
|------|------|------|-----|------|---------|
| talos-cp-01 | Control Plane | 4 | 6 GB | 32 GB | etcd, kube-apiserver, scheduler, controller-manager |
| talos-cp-02 | Control Plane | 4 | 6 GB | 32 GB | etcd, kube-apiserver, scheduler, controller-manager |
| talos-cp-03 | Control Plane | 4 | 6 GB | 32 GB | etcd, kube-apiserver, scheduler, controller-manager |
| talos-worker-01 | Worker | 4 | 8 GB | 100 GB | Application workloads |
| talos-worker-02 | Worker | 4 | 8 GB | 100 GB | Application workloads |
| talos-worker-03 | Worker | 4 | 8 GB | 100 GB | Application workloads |

**Physical Hardware:**
- Proxmox Host: ThinkCentre M90T, 48GM RAM & GPU 1660 Super
- Storage: local storage
